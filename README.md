# COMP560: KenKen Puzzle

Group Members: Everett Desern, Yosef Saleh, and David Firrincieli


To run our code, run the Main class. You might have to change the file location where it says "File inputFile = new File(" ").


The output of this class should be the solved kenken puzzle, the backtracking number of iterations, and the local search number of iterations.


Our write up is under the PDF named "COMP 560".
